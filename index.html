However, the public is unaware that A.C.M.E, with all their fancy agents exuding competency in the art of secrecy and conspirations, has been a failure since the sixteenth century. This map visualizes the agents A.C.M.E has sought without success in four different periods. Join us to explore a story of incompetence while we acknowledge some of the most infamous spies A.C.M.E has tried to capture.</p>

According to one account, in the spring of 1916, while she was living in The Hague, a German consul is said to have offered to pay her for whatever information she could obtain on her next trip to France. After her arrest by the French, she acknowledged only that she had given some outdated information to a German intelligence officer. The German government publicly exculpated her in 1930, and the French dossier documenting her activities reportedly indicated her innocence.',
